# Snake

Welcome to the repo of our snake project for SEM 2019.

## Getting Started

We use Spring for our app and have seperated client from server. In order to connect these two you have to set some variables.
First of all we require postgresql to be present with a running server. \template\server\src\main\resources\application.properties you will find certain variables.

Change the username and password to your PSQL username and password, also change the port number and DB name (5432/postgres in the picture) to the port and database name your PSQL server is running.
